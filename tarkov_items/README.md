# Layout

There are two type of views
1. All vendor view
2. Single vendor view

#### All vendor view
Ideal for desktop use. You must scroll horizontally to be able to see all vendors.

#### Single vendor view
Ideal for mobile use. While in this view, there are two buttons that sticks to the top of the screen that allows changing between vendors.

# How data is stored
This webpage uses localstorage to store data, which isn't shared between browsers. The stored data can be viewed by opening the DevTools (F12), then going to `Application -> Local Storage -> file://`. To delete the data, right click on `file://` and press `clear`.

# Why is everything (like the CSS) in a single file?
I didn't know you could host webpages with a free GitHub account. Originally the idea was to make a single html file that users could download and run on their browser, like an app. Currently this still can be done.
