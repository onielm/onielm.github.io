[Beta] Tarkov items- items needed to be found in raid for quests
https://onielm.github.io/tarkov_items/beta/

Progress isn't shared between pages.

There might be some upcoming features here, but the main focus of this "Beta" is to test updates without breaking the main site (some stuff load differently depending on whether it is online or local).
